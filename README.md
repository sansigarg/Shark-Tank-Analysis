# Shark-Tank-Analysis
Analysis to answer the question what it takes to get funding on Shark Tank

## Project Overview
Created a Tableau Dashboard to analyze what kind of ventures get funding on the show 'Shark Tank'.

## Background
We were given a dataset from the show 'Shark Tank' with different feature for each venture that pitched on the show and whether that venture got funding or not. 

## The Goal
Goal was to identify common features that lead to a venture getting funded. We identified the audience as Entreprenuers and business owners. 

## Analysis
We analyzed the following features:
1. Categories of the ventures
2. States from where these ventures were
3. Gender of the entreprenuers
4. How many entreprenuers were there
5. The 'Ask' equity, amount and valuations versus the 'Deal' one
6. Shark wise analysis
